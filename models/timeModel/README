How to gather the experiment data for time model (a. cpu cycles. b. dalvik instruction counts. c. method invocation counts):

1. Choose the app you want, get the package id by checking /data/system/packagelist inside abd shell.
2. Create a file with package id as the first line and '2' as the second line. Push it to /sdcard/
3. Push printTime.sh into /data/
4. Set up oprofile in adb shell using 
	opcontrol --setup
	opcontrol --event=CPU_CYCLES:<number> --separate-thread=1
	opcontrol --start
5. Start the app and check its process id as pid
6. Play the app for a while
7. When you want to stop, run printTime.sh inside adb shell:
	printTime.sh <pid>
8. Use adb logcat to get the dalvik instruction counts and method invocation counts.
9. Use opimport_pull to pull out profiling data(cpu cycles:
	opimport_pull -p <pid> -r <outputdir>
